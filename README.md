# Ghost Ship Gatsby Starter

Create a Gatsby site that includes blog posts, Markdown pages, and [Nautilus](https://nautilus.octopusthink.com/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the `ghost-ship` as your starter:

    ```bash
    # Create a new Gatsby site using the ghost-ship starter.
    npx gatsby new my-site https://github.com/octopusthink/ghost-ship
    ```

2.  **Start the development server.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd my-site/
    yarn start # or `npm start` if you use `npm`.
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/)!
